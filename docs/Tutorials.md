# HomeSpan Tutorials

*(editing in progress)*

### Example 1 - [SimpleLightBulb](../examples/01-SimpleLightBulb/01-SimpleLightBulb.ino)
This first example introduces the HomeSpan library and demonstrates how to implement a simple on/off light control using a combination of HomeSpan Accessory, Service, and Characteristic objects.  Once this sketch has been uploaded to your HomeSpan device and the device is paired to your home, a new "lightbulb" tile will appear in the Home App of your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Though the tile will be fully operational (i.e. you can change the status of the lightbulb from "on" or "off"), we won't yet connect an actual light or LED to the HomeSpan device, so nothing real will light up.  Instead, in this and the next few examples, we'll focus on learning about the different ways HomeKit controls can be configured.  Starting in Example 5, we'll connect an LED to the device and introduce the methods that actually turn the LED on and off from your Home App.

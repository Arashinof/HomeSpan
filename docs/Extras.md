# HomeSpan Extras

HomeSpan includes integrated access to a number of ESP32 features you'll likely find particularly useful when constructing your HomeSpan devices.

## Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)

PWM on the ESP32 is more flexible, but slighly more complicated, than PWM on most Arduino devices (like the Uno or Mega).  On the ESP32, you use one of 16 built-in timers to create a PWM signal, and then link that channel to any ESP32 pin.

# Pairing HomeSpan using QR Codes

Pairing a HomeKit Accessory Device to your Home App using the Device's 9-digit Setup Code typically involves to steps:

* Selecting the Device you wish to pair from the list of all HomeKit Devices the Home App has found, and that have not yet been paired; and
* Providing the Home App with the Device's 9-digit Setup Code.

The order you perform these two steps depends on whether you have a scannable tag displaying the 9-digit Setup Code in the Scancardium font.  If so, you can scan the tag first, and then select the Device to begin pairing.  If not, you select the Device first, and then enter the 9-digit Setup Code to begin the pairing process.  In either cases, the Home App displays the name as well as an icon reflected the category type (Light, Fan, etc.) for each Device it has found.
